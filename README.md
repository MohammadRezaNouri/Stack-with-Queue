# Queue with Stack
In this program, which is written in C++ language and in a modular way, we have implemented the stack structure data using two queues.

## Time complexity
|   push   |   pop   |
|----------|---------|
|   O(1)   |   O(n)  |

## Prerequisite
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

Of course, you can also compile without using cmake.

## Compatibility
You should be able to run this program anywhere. For the compiling process, both of [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) should work.
### Tested Environments
OS:  [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/uk-ua/) Windows 10 Pro x64

Compiler: [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) C++ Compiler (8.1.0)

Building: [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system (3.19.0-rc1)

## Cloning
```
git clone https://github.com/MohammadRezaNouri/Stack-with-Queue
```

## Installation
### Windows
open the cmd or PowerShell and go to files directory with cd command and execute the following commands :

With [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cd Debug
./app
```
Without [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

Put all .h and .cpp files in one folder.
```bash
g++ *.cpp -o app -O2
./app
```

### Linux

With [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
